        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day, I wanted to explore all finite groups of low order.
This is something that has already nicely been done by the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nathancarter.github.io&#x2F;group-explorer&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;Group Explorer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; project
and in the great &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RnqwFpyqJFw&amp;list=PL8yHsr3EFj51pjBvvCPipgAT3SYpIiIsJ&quot;&gt;Group Theory lectures by Richard Borcherds&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
I wanted to look into this myself and just started by producing multiplication tables of the first small groups.
This always feels a bit like doing a Sudoku to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have written before &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;making-a-mess-is-part-of-being-creative&#x2F;&quot;&gt;about creativity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and I&#x27;ve thought and read about it a bit recently.
There are 2 main things that I have recently discovered:
First, the idea that quantity leads to quality. I read &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;austinkleon.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;10&#x2F;quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this article&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Austin Kleon&#x27;s blog (which I think I found via &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattragland.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Matt Ragland&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&#x27;s newsletter.
This idea is as simple as it is evident, the more you practice, the better you get.
But as trivial as it sounds, it is also non-trivial at the same time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, I watched the documentary &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;ondemand&#x2F;theworldofthinking&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The world of Thinking&amp;quot; on Vimeo.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
I chose to watch it because it portraits the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Institute_for_Advanced_Study&quot;&gt;Institute of Advanced Study&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (IAS for short) which is a fascinating place to me.
It is located in Princeton, New Jersey, USA, and was the scientific home to many great and well-known mathematicians and theoretical physicists.
It does indeed harbor scientists of other disciplines as well but those are of less interest to me.
&amp;quot;The Institute&amp;quot;, as it is often called, is a special place in that it is the closest implementation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ivory_tower&quot;&gt;Ivory Tower&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Science.
The purpose of the Institute is to allow a few select scientists to focus as good as possible on expanding the boundaries of human knowledge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I could write a blog from scratch, what would I write about?
Why would I want to write a blog in the first place?
I have had a blog in one form or another for many years but I never got into a habit of contiually posting to on them.
The obvious answer to the question on what to write about is to write about the things that occupy my mind, that I find interesting or that move me.
I guess the only way to learn what I want to write about is to just write about something for a while.
Many people advocate this technique and I have tried it before but the attempt died of perfectionism.
I guess some of the articles that I have published in my last run were just too ambitious and took too much time to research and prepare.
This time I should try to write simpler and more frequent blog posts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I&#x27;ve started working with reward-modulated STDP in spiking neural networks, I got curious about the background of research on which it was based. This led me to the book by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto called &amp;quot;Reinforcement Learning&amp;quot;.  The book is from 1998 and it&#x27;s freely readable on the internet! In the book&#x27;s Introduction they cover the example of an agent learning to beat a given (imperfect) agent in the game of Tic Tac Toe. Two remarks have to be made: 1. The agent has to be imperfect because a perfect agent in Tic Tac Toe (if it&#x27;s the one doing the first move) can never be beaten. 2. The agent does not learn to play Tic Tac Toe, this skill is assumed, but it learns a value map for its policy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
