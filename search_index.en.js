Theory\":\n\nShow that the alternating group A4 has no subgroup of order 6.\n\n\nLet's first note that A4 has order 12 and that according to\nLagrange's theorem, a subgroup\nof order 6 could be possible because 6 divides 12. \nWe can also observe that A4 has a subgroup of order 4. Look at its multiplication table's upper\nleft 4x4 block. The block contains the identity (black) in every row an column and there are only\nfour colors involved.\n\nLet's assume that A4 had a subgroup, call it H, of order 6. Then it had to be\nisomorphic to the symmetric group of order 3. This is because there are only 2\ngroups of order 6 and A4 has no elements of order 6 and can therefore not be\nisomorphic to the cyclic group of order 6.\nAs a side note, the fact that one can list all groups that exist, up to a\ncertain finite order, was something I found surprising when I read it initially.\nIt's kind of cool that you can make a complete table of the groups of low\norder.\nNext, we check that there are no elements of order 6 in the group and that it\ntherefore cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 6. A4's cycle\ndiagram below only shows 2-cycles and 3-cycles.\n\nLet's take stock:\n\nIf our subgroup H &lt; A4 of order 6 existed, it would be isomorphic to S3. But\nS3 is a group that contains 3 elements of order 2, see below diagram.\nA4 also has a subgroup of order 4 containing its only 3 elements of order 2.\n\n\nThis implies that H would have to contain a subgroup of order 4. But that's a\ncontradiction to Lagrange's theorem which states that every subgroup's order has\nto divide the group's order. Therefore, H cannot exist and there is no subgroup\nof order 6 inside A4.\nThanks for reading and thanks to the author of this answer on math\nstackexchange: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1334010\nNote to self: SVG files with transparent background and black content don't work\nwell on dark background\n","id":"https://andreas.hartel.me/alternating-group/","title":"Alternating Group"},"https://andreas.hartel.me/andrew-wiles-quotes/":{"body":"Here's a little thread post with two quotes 💬 from Andrew Wiles' Abel Prize\ninterview. Those quotes helped me better understand what research (mathematics)\nfeels like. Here's a link to the interview\n1 The dark mansion\nHere's the first quote: \"Perhaps I could best describe my experience of doing\nmathematics in terms of entering a dark mansion. One goes into the ﬁrst room,\nand it’s dark, completely dark.\"\nHe goes on: \"One stumbles around bumping into the furniture, and gradually, you\nlearn where each piece of furniture is, and ﬁnally, after six months or so, you\nﬁnd the light switch. You turn it on, and suddenly, it’s all illuminated. You\ncan see exactly where you were\"\nI always liked this metaphor in so many ways. First, it describes the struggle\nwhen you read an unknown concept for the first time and have no idea and try to\nunderstand it. Then, it describes this feeling of finally understanding a\nconcept.\nThe partially discovered mansion is also a nice metaphor for how personal each\nindividual's math journey is. Everyone has their personal favorite rooms to\nwhich they return again and again because something in their attracts them and\nthey enjoy discovery. \n2 The busy squirrel\nThe second quote is about perseverance. Towards the end of the interview, he\nlikens solving a math problem to being a squirrel that is looking for nuts high\nup in one of several tall trees. Since it doesn't know which tree has the nuts,\nit tries one tree after another, always giving up after 30 feet and never\nfinding anything.\nBut if someone told it which tree is the right one, then it\nwould just keep going on this one tree as high as necessary until it finds the\nnuts.\nI think what he's saying with this quote is a) never give up and b) trust your\nintution as to which approach to take to solve a problem.

Or, in other words, making a mess is definitely a part of the creative process.\n\nWhat do I mean by that: If you want to be creative you will first have to play around with the tools you have at hand. And during this process it is important to just try something without thinking too much about the ultimate goal. Part of the process is just to do something, see what happens and then start over, until eventually, you arrive at something you like.\nThe part of making a mess might involve writing down fragments of sentences onto a sheet of paper or typing it into a text editor. It might also involve drawing all sorts of funny ideas onto many sheets of paper, or even drawing the same thing over and over again while refining it in the process. Or, when writing software, it involves creating many different versions of the same software while refining the structure of the code.\nOf course, at some point you might end up having to prepare a final version that you want to deploy. This is then the least pleasant part, it's the part when you need to file through all the ideas that you've produced and pick the gems out of the dusty ruins. At this point you need to be able to remember what you did and where you roughly did that.\nI think Christoph Niemann summarized this process quite nicely in Abstract: The Art of Design: You want to „be a much more ruthless editor and at the same time be a much more careless artist.“ He also summarized this process nicely in this article for the New Yorker.\nThus, you want to iterate between being a careless and&nbsp; almost child-like artist and on the other hand being a ruthless editor that drives the iterative process into the right direction.\n","id":"https://andreas.hartel.me/making-a-mess-is-part-of-being-creative/","title":"Making a mess is part of being creative"},"https://andreas.hartel.me/math-test/":{"body":"This page tests math support.\n\nWhen $a \\ne 0$, there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are\n$$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}.$$\n","id":"https://andreas.hartel.me/math-test/","title":"Math test"},"https://andreas.hartel.me/on-productivity-in-math/":{"body":"Inspired by Terry Tao's career advice page and by a recent interview on\nMath-Life balance, I collected here some thoughts on productivity in math. The\nrecent interview was with Saul\nGlasman and in it he mentioned, more as a side note, that math research is hard\nbecause one often gets stuck while working on a problem. It's just very hard to\nfocus for a long time on a single problem, seemingly without any progress. But\nthe crucial insight here is, in my opinion, the fact that it only seems as if there is no progress.\nAccording to Glasman, when it happens that you work too long on a problem and\nthen take a break, you can't really get yourself to work on it again and start\nfeeling bad because you think you must work on that one problem until there is a\nbreakthrough. This leads to a downward spiral because you think that it is your\njob to work on or solve this problem and you can't even get yourself to do your\njob. But this is probably false and Terry Tao knew this for a long time.\n\nThis is wrong because:\n\nnobody tells you which problem you should solve\nthere rarely is a discrete single step from not solved to solved when working on a problem\n(i.e. you take many steps and can publish intermediate results)\nWhen you run out of ideas on one problem then you can work on another one \n\nTerry Tao urges you to be flexible and to try to not announce too early which\nproblems you're working on:\n\nAnother corollary is that it is generally not a good idea to announce that you\nare working on a well-known problem before you have a feasible plan for solving\nit, as this can make it harder to gracefully abandon the problem and refocus\nyour attention in more productive directions in the event that the problem is\nmore difficult than anticipated. From https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-flexible/\n\nAnother important topic that Tao mentions is to stay in (or only slightly out of) one's own comfort zone.\n\nI believe that the optimal way to develop one’s talents is to invest in the middle ground between these two extremes, thus adding new challenges and difficulties to your research program in carefully controlled amounts. Examples of such research objectives include:\n\nLooking at the easiest problems of interest that you can’t quite completely handle with your existing tools, for instance by taking an unsolved problem and making various assumptions to “turn off” all but one of the difficulties;\nTaking a known result and reproving it by “tying one hand behind your back”, by forbidding yourself to use a method which is effective for that result, but does not extend well to more difficult problems; or\nTaking a known result and generalising it to a situation in which most of the steps in the standard proof of the existing result look like they will extend, but which have just one or two parts which look tricky and will require some modest new idea, trick or insight.\n[...]\nThis is somewhat analogous to exploiting the power of compound interest in long-term investing; imagine, for instance, what your mathematical abilities would be like in a couple decades if you were able to improve your range by, say, 10% a year. From https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/continually-aim-just-beyond-your-current-range/\n\n\nTao also has advice for what to do when one does not want to work on that major\nproblem that one has not managed to solve in spite of so many (fruitless)\nattempts. These are Learn and relearn your\nfield and\nask yourself dumb questions (and answer\nthem).\nThese approaches provide you with an endless supply of new problems and\nexercises to work that also make you feel more productive. But it is also\nimportant to pick each task according to the energy level of the day (or hour),\nas he explains in his thoughts on time\nmanagement.

This led me to the book by&nbsp;Richard Sutton&nbsp;and Andrew Barto&nbsp;called&nbsp;\"Reinforcement Learning\". &nbsp;The book is from 1998 and it's freely readable on the internet! In the book's Introduction they cover the example of an agent learning to beat a given (imperfect) agent in the game of Tic Tac Toe. Two remarks have to be made: 1. The agent has to be imperfect because a perfect agent in Tic Tac Toe (if it's the one doing the first move) can never be beaten. 2. The agent does not learn to play Tic Tac Toe, this skill is assumed, but it learns a value map for its policy.\n\nSince I liked the example and wanted to try it out myself, I decided to write this blog post about it. By the way, the code can be found on github (run ttt_new.py).\nIntroduction\nA few quotes taken from&nbsp;[Sutton &amp; Barto 2005]:\n\nReinforcement learning is different from supervised learning, the kind of learning studied in most current research in machine learning, statistical pattern recognition, and artificial neural networks. Supervised learning is learning from examples provided by a knowledgable external supervisor.\n\n\nClearly, such an agent must be able to sense the state of the environment to some extent and must be able to take actions that affect the state. The agent also must have a goal or goals relating to the state of the environment. The formulation is intended to include just these three aspects--sensation, action, and goal--in their simplest possible forms without trivializing any of them.\n\n\nFigure taken from [Sutton &amp; Barto 2005]\n\nOne of the challenges that arise in reinforcement learning and not in other kinds of learning is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To obtain a lot of reward, a reinforcement learning agent must prefer actions that it has tried in the past and found to be effective in producing reward. But to discover such actions, it has to try actions that it has not selected before. The agent has to exploit what it already knows in order to obtain reward, but it also has to explore in order to make better action selections in the future. The dilemma is that neither exploration nor exploitation can be pursued exclusively without failing at the task.\n\nThe 4 elements of reinforcement learning\nQuotes taken from [Sutton &amp; Barto 2005]\n\n\nRoughly speaking, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states. [...]&nbsp; In some cases the policy may be a simple function or lookup table, whereas in others it may involve extensive computation such as a search process. The policy is the core of a reinforcement learning agent in the sense that it alone is sufficient to determine behavior. In general, policies may be stochastic.\n\n\nA reward function defines the goal in a reinforcement learning problem. Roughly speaking, it maps each perceived state (or state-action pair) of the environment to a single number, a reward, indicating the intrinsic desirability of that state. A reinforcement learning agent's sole objective is to maximize the total reward it receives in the long run.\n\n\nWhereas a reward function indicates what is good in an immediate sense, a value function specifies what is good in the long run. Roughly speaking, the value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state. [...]\nWe seek actions that bring about states of highest value, not highest reward, because these actions obtain the greatest amount of reward for us over the long run. [...]\nRewards are basically given directly by the environment, but values must be estimated and reestimated from the sequences of observations an agent makes over its entire lifetime. In fact, the most important component of almost all reinforcement learning algorithms is a method for efficiently estimating values. The central role of value estimation is arguably the most important thing we have learned about reinforcement learning over the last few decades.\n\n\nThe fourth and final element of some reinforcement learning systems is a model of the environment. This is something that mimics the behavior of the environment. For example, given a state and action, the model might predict the resultant next state and next reward.\n\n\nLearning a value function for Tic Tac Toe\nThe learning process comprises N games. Each game consists of $K \\geq 3$ turns. At the beginning of every game, the board gets reset to a state in which all nine fields are empty. Our agent plays Os and therefore plays the first turn in every game. At the beginning of the learning process the value map is initialized to 0.5 for every board state except for board states that show winning configurations for O, those have value 1.0, and board states that show draws or winning configurations for X, those have value 0.0.\nOur agent can make two types of moves (actions): 1. Exploratory moves that ignore the value of the resulting board configuration and 2. Greedy moves that seek to maximize the value of the resulting board configuration. The probability of picking an exploratory move is $p_{ex}$.\nAfter every greedy move, we update the value of the state $s$ before our opponents last move to become a bit closer to the value of the state $s'$ after our last move: $V(s) \\leftarrow V(s) + \\alpha [V(s') - V(s)]$. This is detailed in the following picture:\n\nFigure taken from [Sutton &amp; Barto 2005]\nThe idea behind this update rule is to make the value of that would have resulted from our previous move closer to the value after our current move. This way, the value propagates back from the goal state along our chain of actions towards the start state.\nAccording to [Sutton &amp; Barto 2005],\n\nThis update rule is an example of a temporal-difference learning method, so called because its changes are based on a difference, $V(s') - V(s)$, between estimates at two different times.\n\nEach game is a series of board configurations. For greedy turns, the agent has to calculate all board configurations for all possible actions and pick the one with the highest value. Since the value map is initialized to 0.5 for all states except winning and losing ones and since there are 19,683 board states (naively counted) it makes sense to evaluate the value map lazily (although I must admit they I have not optimized my code and I have not verified this assumption).\nAn implementation of TD learning for TTT\nI've implemented a version of this in Python. The code can be found on github (run ttt_new.py). This version chooses exploratory steps with a probability of $p_{ex}=0.01$.\nThe results of running the learning agent against a sub-optimal hard-coded oponent are shown in the following image. I ran 10,000 games in total and let the agent learn after each of its moves. The probability of it winning is shown in the picture for batches of 500 games. We can see that after approximately half the games it has learned how to beat the hard-coded agent about 80% of times.\n\nResults of a training run. Fraction of wins of each agent and draws over training runs.\nFurther questions\n\nWhat is dynamic programming?\nWhat are the combinatorics of TTT (c.f.

If I remember correctly, then I think\nI saw him do\n\nthe Stack Kata\nthe prime factors Kata\nthe bowling score Kata\n\nRecently then, I ran into this blog post by Peter Provost called\nKata - the Only Way to Learn TDD.\nThis blog post mentions 2 TDD Katas, with an exact sequence of recommended tests\nwhich I would like to collect here for easier reference.\n\nBefore Peter goes into details about the Katas, he mentions the following\nadvice, which also gives the blog post its title:\"\n\nLately I’ve been asked by more and more people inside Microsoft to help them really learn to do TDD. [...]\nMy guidance to them is simple. Do a TDD kata every morning for two weeks.\nLimit yourself to 30 minutes each morning. Then pick another kata and do it again.\n\nLet's now look at the 2 Katas which he mentions in detail.\nThe Bowling Game Kata\nUncle Bob breaks this kata down into the following five tests:\n\nGutter game scores zero - When you roll all misses, you get a total score of zero.\nAll ones scores 20 - When you knock down one pin with each ball, your total score is 20.\nA spare in the first frame, followed by three pins, followed by all misses scores 16.\nA strike in the first frame, followed by three and then four pins, followed by all misses, scores 24.\nA perfect game (12 strikes) scores 300.\n\nThe String Calculator Kata\n\nAn empty string returns zero\nA single number returns the value\nTwo numbers, comma delimited, returns the sum\nTwo numbers, newline delimited, returns the sum\nThree numbers, delimited either way, returns the sum\nNegative numbers throw an exception\nNumbers greater than 1000 are ignored\nA single char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. //# for a ‘#’ as the delimiter)\nA multi char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. //[###] for ‘###’ as the delimiter)\nMany single or multi-char delimiters can be defined (each wrapped in square brackets)\n\n","id":"https://andreas.hartel.me/tdd-katas/","title":"Collecting TDD Katas"},"https://andreas.hartel.me/the-world-of-thinking/":{"body":"Last week, I watched the documentary \"The world of Thinking\" on Vimeo.\nI chose to watch it because it portraits the Institute of Advanced Study (IAS for short) which is a fascinating place to me.\nIt is located in Princeton, New Jersey, USA, and was the scientific home to many great and well-known mathematicians and theoretical physicists.\nIt does indeed harbor scientists of other disciplines as well but those are of less interest to me.\n\"The Institute\", as it is often called, is a special place in that it is the closest implementation of the Ivory Tower of Science.\nThe purpose of the Institute is to allow a few select scientists to focus as good as possible on expanding the boundaries of human knowledge.\n\nWhat makes the movie \"The world of Thinking\" particularly interesting is that it portraits the institute, it's operating mode and 5 individuals that worked and lived there while the movie was shot.\nThese are Freeman Dyson, Helmut Hofer, Vladimir Voevodsky, Nima Arkani-Hamed and Yvonne Geyer.\nIt portraits nicely what motivates those people and it shows also that while they are completely free to chose the direction of their research and while they are completely freed from everyday chores and worries they still have their struggles which are then mostly psychological.\nI must admit that the basic premise of the Institute sounds tempting at first.\nSomeone pays you money, provides you with an accommodation, food and an office.\nYou get in contact with the best scientists in the world in your field. If they don't already work next door then you can just invite them to work with you (at least that's how I imagine things to happen over there).\nBut then at a second glance, you might realise that the pressure that the people who work there put on themselves is huge.\nProgress in research is an uncertain, non-deterministic process.\nThis is in the movie best illustrated with the example of Yvonne Geyer who, it seems, must just have finished her PhD before she came to the IAS.\nShe speeks openly about the pressure she feels when working at the IAS and when collaborating with her role models.\nOne of her role models is Nima Arkani-Hamed, a theoretical physicist who has been portrayed already by Quantamagazine and in the movie \"Particle Fever\".\nIn \"The World of Thinking\", he explains what drives him to work so hard, what his childhood has to do with his desire to do something great with his life and what it takes to be a great researcher.\nHe is also described as \"never tired\" and \"always out there\" by Yvonne Geyer, basically as someone who is always on the hunt for breakthroughs and never reluctant to discuss great physics with his colleagues.\nThe stories that moved me most were those of Vladimir Voevodsky and Helmut Hofer because both of them experienced seriously life changing events in their lives.\nVladimir Voevodsky apparently developed something like schizophrenia (at least that's what John Nash suffered from andn Voevodsky mentions having talked to Nash about his own experienced and having found similarities).\nAnd while he was apparently able to live with this state of mind for a long time, the outro of the movie mentions that he had died 9 weeks after his last interview with the film crew.\nI could not help but wonder if the psychological changes he experienced earlier in life were somehow correlates of an earlier physiological damage in his brain, but I will probably never know.\nAnd then there was Helmut Hofers story.\nThis man worked for more than 15 years on his masterpiece mathematical theory and then lost his son during the year in which he finally wanted to finish his manuscript.\nAnd it was clearly visible from the interviews what this experience had done to this man who was probably around 60 when the interviews for the movie were recorded.\nVery sad to watch.\nOverall, I really liked the movie and would certainly recommend it.\nThe footage of the Institute itself and the whole estate was great.\nAnd then one other thing that I found particularly pleasing was that the historical anecdotes and life stories that were told by the interviewees have all been illustrated with some footage.\nWhile this was never original footage, it was always chosen and edited in such a way that it did not distract from the voice the interviewee but it would always add a feeling to the whole story and help the viewer's imagination to travel back in time and live through the story together with its narrator.\n","id":"https://andreas.hartel.me/the-world-of-thinking/","title":"The world of Thinking"}},"docInfo":{"https://andreas.hartel.me/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://andreas.hartel.me/about/":{"body":8,"title":1},"https://andreas.hartel.me/alternating-group/":{"body":207,"title":2},"https://andreas.hartel.me/andrew-wiles-quotes/":{"body":185,"title":4},"https://andreas.hartel.me/blackout-poems/":{"body":12,"title":3},"https://andreas.hartel.me/caleys-theorem/":{"body":68,"title":3},"https://andreas.hartel.me/cory-doctorow-on-blogging/":{"body":139,"title":3},"https://andreas.hartel.me/creativity/":{"body":181,"title":1},"https://andreas.hartel.me/first-post/":{"body":65,"title":2},"https://andreas.hartel.me/groups-of-order-4/":{"body":142,"title":3},"https://andreas.hartel.me/how-to-write-a-book/":{"body":18,"title":2},"https://andreas.hartel.me/linkage/":{"body":51,"title":1},"https://andreas.hartel.me/making-a-mess-is-part-of-being-creative/":{"body":174,"title":5},"https://andreas.hartel.me/math-test/":{"body":19,"title":2},"https://andreas.hartel.me/on-productivity-in-math/":{"body":351,"title":2},"https://andreas.hartel.me/reinforcement-learning-1/":{"body":705,"title":5},"https://andreas.hartel.me/tdd-bowling-kata-solved/":{"body":312,"title":4},"https://andreas.hartel.me/tdd-katas/":{"body":235,"title":3},"https://andreas.hartel.me/the-world-of-thinking/":{"body":374,"title":2}},"length":19},"lang":"English"};
