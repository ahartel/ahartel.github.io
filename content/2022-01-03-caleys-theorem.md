I recently saw a video by Michael Penn
[https://youtube.com/c/MichaelPennMath](https://youtube.com/c/MichaelPennMath) that explained
Cayley's theorem in #grouptheory very nicely and in a way that was very clear to me.

On the other hand, I recently saw a video on the same topic by Richard Borcherds
[https://youtu.be/AZUDhtnz-Do](https://youtu.be/AZUDhtnz-Do) that explained it in a more abstract way and resonated less well
with me. I then wondered why my reception was so different?

While I do like Borcherds' lecture videos in general, I guess that this particular one had a much
less clear page layout or flow of thought. It was mixing in too many side tracks. And Penn's black
board was very nicely structured in this case.

This also made it again clear to me how individual different people's learning journeys in #math are.
