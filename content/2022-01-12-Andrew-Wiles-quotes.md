Here's a little thread post with two quotes üí¨ from Andrew Wiles' Abel Prize
interview. Those quotes helped me better understand what research (mathematics)
feels like. [Here's a link to the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWKAzX5U85Q)

## 1 The dark mansion
Here's the first quote: "Perhaps I could best describe my experience of doing
mathematics in terms of entering a dark mansion. One goes into the Ô¨Årst room,
and it‚Äôs dark, completely dark."

He goes on: "One stumbles around bumping into the furniture, and gradually, you
learn where each piece of furniture is, and Ô¨Ånally, after six months or so, you
Ô¨Ånd the light switch. You turn it on, and suddenly, it‚Äôs all illuminated. You
can see exactly where you were"

I always liked this metaphor in so many ways. First, it describes the struggle
when you read an unknown concept for the first time and have no idea and try to
understand it. Then, it describes this feeling of finally understanding a
concept.

The partially discovered mansion is also a nice metaphor for how personal each
individual's math journey is. Everyone has their personal favorite rooms to
which they return again and again because something in their attracts them and
they enjoy discovery. 

## 2 The busy squirrel
The second quote is about perseverance. Towards the end of the interview, he
likens solving a math problem to being a squirrel that is looking for nuts high
up in one of several tall trees. Since it doesn't know which tree has the nuts,
it tries one tree after another, always giving up after 30 feet and never
finding anything.
But if someone told it which tree is the right one, then it
would just keep going on this one tree as high as necessary until it finds the
nuts.

I think what he's saying with this quote is a) never give up and b) trust your
intution as to which approach to take to solve a problem. But this approach
obviously requires good intuition in the first place.
