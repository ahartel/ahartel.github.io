            <p>I have written before <a href="/blog/making-a-mess-is-part-of-being-creative/">about creativity</a> and I've thought and read about it a bit recently.
There are 2 main things that I have recently discovered:
First, the idea that quantity leads to quality. I read <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/">this article</a> on Austin Kleon's blog (which I think I found via <a href="http://mattragland.com/">Matt Ragland</a>'s newsletter.
This idea is as simple as it is evident, the more you practice, the better you get.
But as trivial as it sounds, it is also non-trivial at the same time.</p>

            <p>Last week, I watched the documentary <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/theworldofthinking">&quot;The world of Thinking&quot; on Vimeo.</a>
I chose to watch it because it portraits the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study">Institute of Advanced Study</a> (IAS for short) which is a fascinating place to me.
It is located in Princeton, New Jersey, USA, and was the scientific home to many great and well-known mathematicians and theoretical physicists.
It does indeed harbor scientists of other disciplines as well but those are of less interest to me.
&quot;The Institute&quot;, as it is often called, is a special place in that it is the closest implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_tower">Ivory Tower</a> of Science.
The purpose of the Institute is to allow a few select scientists to focus as good as possible on expanding the boundaries of human knowledge.</p>

            <p>If I could write a blog from scratch, what would I write about?
Why would I want to write a blog in the first place?
I have had a blog in one form or another for many years but I never got into a habit of contiually posting to on them.
The obvious answer to the question on what to write about is to write about the things that occupy my mind, that I find interesting or that move me.
I guess the only way to learn what I want to write about is to just write about something for a while.
Many people advocate this technique and I have tried it before but the attempt died of perfectionism.
I guess some of the articles that I have published in my last run were just too ambitious and took too much time to research and prepare.
This time I should try to write simpler and more frequent blog posts.</p>

<div class="post-content">
            <p>Inspired by Terry Tao's career advice page and by a recent interview on
Math-Life balance, I collected here some thoughts on productivity in math. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3SzIbVfeUw">The
recent interview</a> was with Saul
Glasman and in it he mentioned, more as a side note, that math research is hard
because one often gets stuck while working on a problem. It's just very hard to
focus for a long time on a single problem, seemingly without any progress. But
the crucial insight here is, in my opinion, the fact that it only seems as if there is no progress.</p>
<p>According to Glasman, when it happens that you work too long on a problem and
then take a break, you can't really get yourself to work on it again and start
feeling bad because you think you must work on that one problem until there is a
breakthrough. This leads to a downward spiral because you think that it is your
job to work on or solve this problem and you can't even get yourself to do your
job. But this is probably false and Terry Tao knew this for a long time.</p>
